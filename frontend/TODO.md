# Portfolio Website Development Plan

## Information Gathered

- Project is a React app using Vite with React 19.
- Current App.jsx is the default template.
- Components folder exists with some files (Navbar, Hero, About, Skills, Projects, Contact) but likely empty.
- Need to create Experience component as per task.
- Styling will use modern CSS with responsiveness, animations, and hover effects.

## Plan

- Create reusable components: Navbar, Hero, About, Skills, Projects, Experience, Contact.
- Update App.jsx to render all sections.
- Apply consistent styling: Dark theme with blue accents, modern typography, spacing.
- Ensure responsiveness for desktop, tablet, mobile.
- Add smooth animations and hover effects.

## Dependent Files to be edited

- frontend/src/App.jsx: Update to import and render components.
- frontend/src/App.css: Update for global styles.
- frontend/src/index.css: Update for base styles.
- Create new components in frontend/src/Components/: Hero.jsx, About.jsx, Skills.jsx, Projects.jsx, Experience.jsx, Contact.jsx, Navbar.jsx.

## Followup steps

- Test responsiveness.
- Run the app to verify.
- Add any missing assets if needed.
